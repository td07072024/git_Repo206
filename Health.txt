Illnesses
Compared to other purebred dogs, Bloodhounds suffer an unusually high rate of gastrointestinal ailments, with gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) being the most common type of gastrointestinal problem.[5] The breed also suffers an unusually high incidence of eye, skin, and ear ailments;[5] thus these areas should be inspected frequently for signs of developing problems. Owners should be especially aware of the signs of bloat, which is both the most common illness and the leading cause of death of Bloodhounds. The thick coat gives the breed the tendency to overheat quickly.

Lifespan
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 9.3 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.[6] In a 2004 Kennel Club survey the most common cause of death was gastric dilatation volvulus at 34%, the second leading cause of death in the study was cancer, at 27%.
